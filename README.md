This is **Task-01** for the **Machine Learning Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. The project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to predict the **price of a house** based on:

- Total square footage (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- File used: `train.csv`
- Target variable: `SalePrice`

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression Model)
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab

---

## 🧠 ML Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Selection**
4. **Model Building (Linear Regression)**
5. **Model Evaluation (R² Score, MSE)**
6. **Prediction & Visualization**

---

## 📈 Results

The model was trained on basic numerical features and achieved a decent prediction score using linear regression. Further improvements can be made by including more features and applying regularization or more advanced models.
